Desiderata: I'm searching for really interesting internships outside Italy with great companies in the role of  Datascientist and Software Engineer. I would like to work on the summer to not lose classes at university.

## Working Experiences

- (11/2019-03/2019, 4 months) Researcher at Ca' Foscari University in the field of machine learning. From November 2019 to February 2020.
- (~2015, 1 month) Internship at Corvallis(Padua) programming in COBOL for the Intesa San Paolo Bank. During summer of the year 2015.

## Formation

(2019-2021, 2 years) I'm currently attending a Master's Degree in Computer Science about Artificial Intelligence. I'm working on a sperimental thesis for my master degree.

(2019-2019) Took Italian's State certifications of Junior Engineer in Information Technology with a grade of 180/200.

(2016-2019, 3 years) I took a bachelor's Degree in "Data Science".  I Wrote a thesis about a new programming language oriented on machine learning and deep learning tasks. My grade was 100/110

## Skills,Frameworks and Environments

- Python, involved in Google Revenue Customer Predictions on Kaggle, good in use of frameworks and libraries like: Jupyter Notebook, Numpy, Scipy, ScikitLearn, Pandas, LGBM, XGBoost, LARK, ANTLR and many others. All my thesis are in python.
- Java: wrote a library to manage graphs with statistical/graphical/algorithmic operations such as Markov Chains to find Pi-matrix(on my github). Use of libraries and frameworks like: Android Studio, swing
- R / Rstudio: statistical data analysis, tests for: mean, median, variance, concordance, correlation, data visualisation
- C / C++: concurrency, semaphors, inheritance, meta_programming, type semantics
- Full-stack MEAN developer: typescript, javascript, THREE.js, Angular, MongoDB,Express, SocketIO
- Domain Specific Languages(DSLs) use of ANTLR, LARK
- other skills, ask please

## Certifications

- English B2, certified by my university
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning, certified by Coursera
- ECDL, certified by AICA
- 2 certifications on MATLAB in the field of deep learning
- Scientific Programming with Python by University of Padua

## Awards

- Winner of a scholarship in Machine Learning
- Second Place Hackathon P&G Gillette, Milan

## Projects

- MLL-machine learning language : https://github.com/riccardobernardi/MLL-machine-learning-language
- MLL article on Medium: https://medium.com/@machine.learning.language/mll-machine-learning-language-f4deacf8d2a?source=friends_link&sk=1d57f46e6ea35f02e92b520f83adc487
- Restaurant Management Software: https://github.com/riccardobernardi/TAW-project
- Java library to manage operations on complex graphs using some notions of statistics such as the markovian chain and the steady state distribution. It permits to insert texts and learn the patterns, after that you can forecast the next words you will write on an interactive console. It also provides visualization of graph. https://github.com/riccardobernardi/graphLib

## My Passion

Developer since I was ~13 years old moved by passion. I started with Python,VB,C# watching online videos. I'm really passionate about Python and MachineLearning/DeepLearning. To achieve the best education, I decided to study at ca 'foscari because of the innovative nature of its courses(ranked third best university in Information technology by censis 2019).  I'm very competitive so I partecipate frequently to competitions/ hackathons on kaggle and other platform or in the real world.
