Desiderata: I'm searching for really interesting internships outside Italy with great companies with the role of researcher in the area of Graphs, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, in general Artificial Intelligence. I'm also interested in statistics, physics, mathematics, optimization.

## Currently

- seeking for a PhD in Computer Science
- writing a scientific paper about machine learning and domain specific language engineering
- writing a scientific paper about deep learning in cultural heritage

## Working Experiences

- (11/2019-03/2020, 4 months) Researcher at Ca' Foscari University in the field of machine learning. From November 2019 to February 2020. Worked in Python on topics of machine learning and parsing.
- (~2015, 1 month) Internship at Corvallis(Padua) programming in COBOL for the Intesa San Paolo Bank. During summer of the year 2015.

## Formation

(2019-2021, 2 years) I'm currently attending a Master's Degree in Computer Science about Artificial Intelligence. I'm working on a sperimental thesis for my master degree on Deep Learning. My current average of grades is 28.5/30(higher is better).

(2019-2019) Took Italian's State certifications of Junior Engineer in Information Technology with a grade of 180/200.

(2016-2019, 3 years) I took a bachelor's Degree in "Data Science".  I Wrote a thesis about a new programming language oriented on machine learning and deep learning tasks. My grade was 100/110

(2012-2016, 5 years) Traditional Scientific High School, studied biology, latin, Italian, English, history, mathematics, physics.

## Projects

- MLL-machine learning language : https://github.com/riccardobernardi/MLL-machine-learning-language
- Restaurant Management Software: https://github.com/riccardobernardi/TAW-project
- Java library to manage operations on complex graphs using some notions of statistics such as the markovian chain and the steady state distribution. It permits to insert texts and learn the patterns, after that you can forecast the next words you will write on an interactive console. It also provides visualization of graph. https://github.com/riccardobernardi/graphLib
- antiplagiarism library: https://pypi.org/project/antiplagiarism/
- pygraham library: https://pypi.org/project/pygraham/
- distributed sudoku solver over a cluster of 4 raspberry pi: https://github.com/riccardobernardi/distributed-sudoku-solver
- other projects on my github page.

## My Passion

Developer since I was ~13 years old moved by passion. I started with Python,VB,C# watching online videos. I'm really passionate about Python and MachineLearning/DeepLearning but I also seek for challenges in other fields such as pure physics and pure mathematics. To achieve the best education, I decided to study at ca 'foscari because of the innovative nature of its courses(ranked third best university in Information technology by censis 2019).  I'm very competitive so I partecipate frequently to competitions/ hackathons on kaggle and other platform or in the real world.
